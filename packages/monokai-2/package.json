Great for PHP_\n\nI found that the monokai theme by Kevin was one of the only syntax style's I could put up with in the ATOM EDITOR. I was use to years of sublime editing with standard Monokai. However, I added in a few color features for PHP and Javascript. This has been tested and works with PHP, Javascript, CSS, SASS, HTMl, maybe pug. Can add more if requested.\n\n### I added these features:\n* Function parameter's orange color that work\n* Made function calls torquiose color ish\n    * Wanted to make function calls easier to point out\n* Variable colors inside of a SQL string will be light orange ish\n    * Made variables in SQL strings easier to find\n* Single quote strings are hard yellow, double quote strings are light yellow\n    * Just made it easier to keep my code uniform\n* Made quotes for function params green (same color as function title)\n* lastly, made <?php ?> tags lime green\n    * They now stand out if embedding in html\n\n[![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegifter/monokai-2/master/Monokai-2-demo.JPG)](https://github.com/thegifter/monokai-2)\n",
